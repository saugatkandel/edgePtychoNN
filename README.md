# edgePtychoNN

This code does real-time inference using NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier Developer kit on the diffraction patterns streamed out from the X-ray detector. The images are streamed out to the Jetson as PVA stream and fed into the inference engine using TensorRT Python API. The embedded GPU system will then perform the inference and sends back the inference outputs as PVA stream to the user interface for viewing. 

The inference is done in batch processing with a batch size of 8 during the demonstration.
